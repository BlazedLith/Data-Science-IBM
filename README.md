# Data Science 101: A Beginner’s Guide

Welcome to my very first portfolio piece!  
This document summarizes what I learned in the **"What is Data Science?"** course from the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the practice of extracting meaningful insights and knowledge from data.  
It blends techniques from:
- **Statistics & Mathematics**
- **Programming & Software Engineering**
- **Domain Knowledge**
- **Data Visualization & Communication**

## Key Steps in a Data Science Project

1. **Understand the Problem** — Define the business or research question.
2. **Collect Data** — Gather data from databases, APIs, sensors, or files.
3. **Clean & Prepare Data** — Fix missing values, outliers, and errors.
4. **Explore Data (EDA)** — Use statistics and plots to uncover patterns and trends.
5. **Model & Analyze** — Build machine learning models to make predictions or generate insights.
6. **Interpret & Communicate** — Present results clearly using visualizations and reports.
7. **Deploy & Maintain** — Put the solution into production and monitor its performance.

## My Goal

I am learning Data Science to gain practical skills in:
- Python programming
- Data cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Building basic machine learning models

I will build and share **small projects for each course** I complete, step by step!
