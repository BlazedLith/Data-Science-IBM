##  Purpose

This repository serves to:
- Keep track of my progress as I complete each course.
- Store my practice notebooks and summaries.
- Build a foundation for future **portfolio projects**.
- Document my growth in Python, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Next Steps

I will:
- Complete each course module.
- Add clear notes and notebooks inside each folder.
- Create separate, polished repos for bigger projects and link them here.
