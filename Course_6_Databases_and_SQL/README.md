# Course 6: Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

This folder contains my final assignment notebook for **Course 6** of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate:  
**Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**

---

## Course Overview

In this course, I learned how to:
- Write SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data  
- Use `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and joins  
- Perform aggregations and subqueries  
- Work with SQL in **Python notebooks** using Python `DB API` and Magic SQL
- Understand relational database concepts

## Project: SQL Practice Assignment

### Project Description  
In the final assignment, I applied SQL queries to a database to:
- Select and filter data based on conditions  
- Group data and compute aggregate statistics  
- Sort query results   
- Integrate SQL with Python for data analysis  

The notebook demonstrates my ability to use SQL to answer data-related questions and produce meaningful results.
