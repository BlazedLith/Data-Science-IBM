## Course Overview

This course was fully project-based. It focused on:
- Applying Python to a real-world dataset
- Importing and cleaning data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing insights
- Using libraries like **Pandas**, and **Plotly**

## Project: Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

### Project Description  
The project aimed to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize stock data for selected companies using Python.  

I:
- Extracted historical stock price data using the **Yahoo Finance API** (`yfinance`)
- Scraped company profile information using **BeautifulSoup** and `requests`
- Loaded and cleaned the data using **Pandas**
- Computed statistics such as moving averages
- Visualized trends and patterns using **Plotly** interactive charts

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end data science pipeline, integrating API access, web scraping, data processing, and visualization.
