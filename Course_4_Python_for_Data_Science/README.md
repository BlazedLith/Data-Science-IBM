# Weather Data Analyzer â€” Course 4 Mini Project

This mini project was created as part of **Course 4: Python for Data Science, AI & Development**, in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.  

---

## Course 4 Overview

In this course, I learned the fundamental building blocks of Python for data science and AI development. Topics covered included:
- Python data types and variables
- Control flow: if-else statements, loops
- Functions and modular programming
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Basic file I/O
- Using Jupyter Notebooks
- Intro to popular libraries: **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and working with APIs

## Mini Project: Weather Data Analyzer

The goal of this project is to combine the skills gained during the course to:
- Fetch live weather data from a public API (MetaWeather)
- Convert the JSON response into a **Pandas DataFrame**
- Clean and organize the data
- Use **NumPy** to compute key statistics (mean, min, max temperature)
- Display the results in a structured and readable form

## What This Project Demonstrates

- API requests and JSON parsing  
- Loading data into Pandas and exploring it  
- Basic data cleaning and selection  
- Using NumPy for numerical calculations  
- Combining multiple Python libraries in a notebook

## Example Outputs

- Daily weather summaries for a given city  
- Mean, max, min temperature calculated using NumPy 

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add matplotlib or seaborn plots for temperature trends  
- Extend to analyze multiple cities at once  
- Export results to a CSV file
