## Key Steps in a Data Science Project

1. **Understand the Problem** — Define the business or research question.
2. **Collect Data** — Gather data from databases, APIs, sensors, or files.
3. **Clean & Prepare Data** — Fix missing values, outliers, and errors.
4. **Explore Data (EDA)** — Use statistics and plots to uncover patterns and trends.
5. **Model & Analyze** — Build machine learning models to make predictions or generate insights.
6. **Interpret & Communicate** — Present results clearly using visualizations and reports.
7. **Deploy & Maintain** — Put the solution into production and monitor its performance.

## Expert Opinions

Experts explained countless times that the most important inherent skills a Data Scientist could have are **Good Storytelling, Critical Thinking and A Curious Mind**. These are the qualities that make a professional Data Scientist. Trying to find all technical abilities in a single Data Scientist is like trying to find a unicorn, it is impossible. That is why whenever making a team of Data Scientists, these are the qualities one must look for along with their specialized technical skills.
