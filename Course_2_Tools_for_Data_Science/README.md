## What I Learned

This course provided an overview of the essential tools and environments used by data scientists. While it was mostly conceptual, it introduced key platforms and toolkits that form the foundation of a modern data science workflow.

### Tools Covered:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **RStudio**
- **Watson Studio**
- **Git and GitHub**
- **SQL interfaces**
- **Common libraries and languages**: Python, R, Scala, Pandas, NumPy

## Assignment Summary

### **Notebook: `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`**

As part of the course, I completed a hands-on assignment in a Jupyter Notebook. It included:

- Writing basic Python code cells
- Practicing markdown formatting inside Jupyter
- Displaying different cell outputs
- Using print statements and basic math operations

The purpose was to get comfortable working in a notebook interface, combining both **code** and **documentation** seamlessly which is a core skill for data scientists.

## Key Takeaways

- Jupyter Notebook is an essential, beginner-friendly environment for prototyping and presenting data science workflows.
- Markdown allows to give clear explanation of your code logic alongside your computations.
- Git and GitHub are widely used for version control and collaborative development.
